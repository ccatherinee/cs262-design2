# How to Use
Simply clone this repository, install the latest version of Python, and run machine.py by typing python machine.py. This will auto-create and populate 3 log files, one for each simulated machine. Similarly, you can run the associated tests for machine.py via python machine_tests.py.

Note that the listening ports of the 3 machines are hardcoded to 11113, 22224, and 33335, and the log files generated by each machine are suffixed by their respective listening ports.
